# Komandant

Komandant is a GUI app that stores and keeps your frequently run CLI commands organized, and allows executing them in a user-friendly way.

## Benefits
- No more frantic searching through your history, trying to find that one command you used God-knows how long ago.
- No more endlessly navigating between commands with the arrow keys.
- No more messing around with the finicky terminal cursor, struggling to paste something in only to find it contained a newline and now the wrong command is already running and spewing out errors.

## Features
- Saves your most frequently used commands and keeps them organized so you can easily find and execute them at any time.
- Advanced control over the command options and parameters, enabling flexible execution and easy switching between behaviors.
